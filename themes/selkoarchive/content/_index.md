# ⚠️: Server is being migrated.

We are still faithfully taking down data, but the server is being migrated and so this
page may not update for some time. We will remove this once we start getting the latest 
and greatest archival pages back up for you!
Welcome to **Andrew's Selkouutiset Archive**. Here you will find a (mostly) clean
and organized collection of YLE.Fi's daily Clear Finnish news articles, together
with English translations via Google Translate.
